# Time Flies
Developed for the Videogame Design and Programming course @ PoliMi

## Overview
Time Flies is a 2D platform adventure for Windows, macOS and Linux, inspired by a natural process we all experience as living beings: aging! Play this innovative game, try to be as fast as you can (your character will lose abilities over the years), survive till the end and go tell people that getting old has never been so much fun!
